## Tutorial: Setting Up A Virtual Machine on Azure
The tutorial on Microsoft Docs is pretty solid. Tutorial here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal>

### Why?
Because certain Azure desktop apps that cannot be run on Macs i.e. the all-important [PowerBI]. **If you are already using a computer running Windows and/or you would prefer to use your Surface, you won't need to set up a virtual machine (VM).** 

### Prerequisites:
This tutorial assumes you have successfully set up an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account] before you begin.

### Notes:
* When choosing the size of your VM (in step 4), choose the cheapest option. You should have been given credits that should cover this cost.
