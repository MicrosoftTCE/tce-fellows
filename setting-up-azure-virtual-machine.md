## Tutorial Link: Setting Up A Virtual Machine on Azure

# Why?
Because there are certain Microsoft Azure desktop apps that cannot be run on Macs i.e. the all-important PowerBI. If you are already using a computer running Windows and/or you would prefer to use your Surface, you won't need to set up a virtual machine (VM). 

# Prerequisites:
This tutorial assumes you have successfully set up an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account] before you begin.

# Tutorial:
I would write up the tutorial, but the one on Microsft Docs already does a great job!
