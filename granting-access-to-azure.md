# Granting Access to Azure Portal

Azure Portal hosts Civic Graph UI and API as well as a connection to our databases (currently hosted on ClearDB).

To grant a fellow access to the Civic Machine Azure Portal group, follow these steps:
1. Use LastPass to log into [portal.azure.com](portal.azure.com) as the civic-machine@outlook.com user
2. Click the username on the top-right and select "My Permissions" or click this [link](https://portal.azure.com/#@civicmachineoutlook.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/d6b238db-2ea5-4c4b-8a39-401d161baddf/users)
3. Click the "Add" button and set the user role as *Owner*, assign access to "Azure AD user, group, or application", and type the fellow's Microsoft email address in the "Select" field
4. Save the changes

Once access has been granted, the fellow will receive an email with instructions on how to access the Portal.
