# Subscriptions - Paid & Free

The services listed in the table below are used by Microsoft Cities team for various projects. Some of the services are paid on a monthly/yearly basis (as inidicated) and are on auto-renew. If payment method needs to be changed, you must log in to each paid service and adjust the billing options accordingly. The following is a guide to each column of the table:

**Subscription** - The name of the subscription service

**Use** - What the service is currently being used for

**Authentication** - How to log into each service. We are currently using LastPass (see John Farmer for access) to store credentials for each service. You can log into LastPass and access the credentials for each or install the [LastPass Google Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=en-US) to populate the credentials for you on each login site.

**Paid/Unpaid** - Indicates whether we currently pay for the service

**Frequency** - Indicates billing cycle for a paid service (N/A if the plan is free/sponsored)
