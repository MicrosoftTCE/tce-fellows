## Namecheap

The domain name techjobsacademy.com is registered with Namecheap. The DNS records are currently managed in Namecheap and shouldn't need to be updated.

## GitHub

We keep code in GitHub, because it's free, easy, and what the civic tech community prefers.
All code lives under the [MicrosoftTCE](https://github.com/MicrosoftTCE) organization, except anything that we want to keep private, which lives directly under the microsoftny user (because this user is grandfathered into a $7/month plan for private repos).

## Deployment

The site is deployed using gh-pages under 'gh-pages' branch. Any push will propagate automatically. 

## New developers

New developers should user their existing GitHub account. It should have 2FA enabled (please enable if this is not already the case).

## Current Status & Future Updates

After two pilot cohorts of Tech Jobs Academy, learnings were compiled into a collection of resources, listed here:

* [Playbook](http://techjobsacademy.com/playbook)
* [Booklet](http://techjobsacademy.com/booklet)
* [Appendix](http://techjobsacademy.com/appendix)

Future work should display these resources as a tab on the home page. The executive decision has been to list them separately until final versions are uploaded.
