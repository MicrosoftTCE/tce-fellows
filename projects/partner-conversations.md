## City Council Paperless Stated
About a year ago, we partnered with City Council to pilot 'Paperless Stated', an initiative dedicated to reducing paper use and modernizing the nature of civic work. Surfaces were introduced into the City Council's Stated meeting to help members better navigate large documents. The event was a success and City Council is interested in permanently procuring 65 surfaces and 2 charging carts. 

The trick right now is making sure that City Council is able to procure the devices without putting out for bid. Their current budget for procurement is between 19-21K. CDWG is the contract holder for Surface under the NYC DCAS (no need for bid). However, this contract requires a spend of $250K. Since the order is around $100K in total spend, it seems that Microsoft may still be able to procure devices to City Council if the orders are broken up into multiple purchases to keep within budget. Our point people at City Council have been introduced to Kat, our Microsoft procurement specialist, who has lengthy experience breaking up orders to fit procurement budgets. At this point in time, we're waiting to hear back from City Council to move forward on the procurement conversation with Kat.
 
Ideally, we'd want to work something out before the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, wraps up her term at the end of the year and new leadership takes over in February.
