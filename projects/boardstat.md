## Hosting & Deployment

BoardStat is deployed on the [Manhattan Borough President's site](http://bit.ly/boardstat) and exists for all 12 of Manhattan's Community Boards. The dashboards are hosted on BetaNYC's private Microsoft Power BI account. Credentials are managed by BetaNYC. 

## Current Status & Future Work

BoardStat will eventually scale to visualize 311 data for all of NYC's Community Boards across the 5 boroughs. There is interest in migrating the product to a workflow that encourages more open-source contributions. The tech stack for this has not yet been finalized.
