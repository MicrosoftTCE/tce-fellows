## How to sync / connect @microsoft.com and personal email
NOTE:  if you connect work email accounts to your phones there will be major security changes to that device. Some of these changes include a more complex password, unchangeable settings (i.e. screen time out settings, etc.) and most importantly, a direct link from your phone to Microsoft PLEASE BE 100% SURE YOU ARE OK WITH CONNECTING YOUR WORK ACCOUNT TO YOUR PERSONAL PHONE. These changes cannot be undone without factory resetting your device!   
  
## Mac vs Microsoft Surface
Shifting from Mac to Surface can be a little confusing but it is not difficult. Please follow this link (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Switch/mac-surface) that will take you through a very well compiled list / steps to make an easy transition.   
Since I have been working with both MacBook Pro and Surface Pro 3, I would like to share some personal experiences regarding the two:  

1) Weight - Surface wins over Mac and is a delight to carry when you have to travel (Comes from a person who travels through public transportation 3 hours every day).  
2) Stand - While Surface seems more portable, using it anywhere is not as comfortable. You really need a flat surface to place it steadily – however, the flexible angles of the stand helps you set the screen at any angle.   
3) Keyboard - Mac definitely scored over the Surface in terms of the keyboard but the new keyboard of Surface Pro 4 is nothing short of amazing. Sometimes the keyboard's backlighting does not work. An easy fix is to press F2.  
4) Touch-pad - Using a mouse with Surface is important if you are used to the smooth touch-pad of a Mac.   
5) Pen - It is a very useful device to make quick notes or to sketch out some quick ideas. The pen is pretty accurate, responsive and is easy to use. Clicking on the top button opens the "One Note" app where you can start writing notes. Pressing the button on the body of the pen erases what you wrote (wherever you move the pen on the screen).  
6) Performance - Surface has proven to be a great performer even when you use high processor intensive applications like Adobe Illustrator / Photoshop or Aftereffects. But you may need an external monitor to work on such projects since the screen size of the Surface is small.   
7) Search - Mac has a search bar to the top right whereas Surface has a search bar on bottom left. You can also use Cortana to help you without typing the terms. One great feature is that once you type something in the search bar, it gives you results from both your Pc and Web unlike Mac.   
8) Cortana - Personally, I like Cortana more than Siri. However, sometimes Cortana is not as responsive as needed.   
9) SD-Card Slot - There is a micro SD card slot in Surface in comparison to the Mac that has a full-sized card slot.  
10) USB Port - Surface has just one USB port that seemed like a bummer initially but it’s not a big deal since you will be provided with a docking station in the office with multiple ports.
