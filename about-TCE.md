Microsoft’s Technology and Civic Engagement (TCE) Team has the unique opportunity to bridge the gap between government and technology relations. Civic Technology, best defined as technology that catalyzes civic participation and increases government performance (e.g. service delivery and city responsiveness), is a nascent field that possesses untapped potential.    

Microsoft specifically created the TCE team to:   
* Understand how society and its use of technology is changing and   
* Aid cities as they make this transition to a “digital government” platform. 

Within the “Civic Tech” movement, there are multiple opportunities for change: open data and transparent government, easier access to tech and infrastructure and tools, 21st century skill for all populations, sustainable cities and robust civic tech communities (e.g. hacker events).  TCE’s approach to fostering innovation and growth in this sector is to provide research on the implications of policy and society, facilitate partnerships across 501c3s, academic institutions, government organizations and private civic tech companies, and connect with the greater community in each city to crowd-source solutions to technical problems.  To contextualize TCE’s impact, some previous initiatives include: providing monetary grants to community partners, supporting innovative government organizations that utilize technology, granting hard/software to civic tech start-ups, assisting with computer science education initiatives, creating an online, interactive “Civic Graph” to illustrate the civic tech community and working with Science Museums to provide STEM/STEAM opportunities.  As a Civic Tech Fellow, your job will be to support the TCE team as they implement new city-wide projects.
